Try out an acordian cadence for the DDFs

Have DDFs with a low-cadence start and end for each observing season. Vary the length of the low cadence protion as well as the total observing season length.

sf: Season fraction: what fraction of the year to consider the field unavailable. Applied to both start and end of the season, so sf=10 means observations will be attempted for 80% of the year
lsf: low season fraction: What fraction of the year is flagged as low cadence. Again, applied to both sides of the season
lsr: Low Season Rate: What fraction of the regular cadence should the low cadence be.
