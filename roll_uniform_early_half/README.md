Example of rolling with special phases to get a uniform survey at Y1, Y4, Y7, and Y10.

This version relative to `roll_uniform` attempts to move some of the rolling seasons around
season 3 to improve uniformity at Y4. The way the footprint is divided in ra was also changed a
bit to try and make sure the divisions in dec always match.
